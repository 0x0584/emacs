Start a vdiff session. If called interactively, you will be
asked to select two files. HORIZONTAL adjusts the buffer's
initial layout. A prefix argument can be used to set this

the vdiff session. It is called with the two vdiff buffers as
arguments.

asked to select two buffers. HORIZONTAL adjusts the buffer's
initial layout. A prefix argument can be used to set this
variable interactively. ON-QUIT is a function to run on exiting
the vdiff session. It is called with the two vdiff buffers as

KILL-BUFFERS-ON-QUIT restore the previous window configuration
and kill the vdiff buffers after quitting vdiff. Note that if you
are going to kill the buffers you should probably be using a
function for ON-QUIT to do something useful with the result.

Resolve outstanding conflicts in FILE using vdiff.

Compare, stage, or resolve using vdiff.

This command tries to guess what file, and what commit or range
the user wants to compare, stage, or resolve using vdiff.  It
might only be able to guess either the file, or range or commit,
in which case the user is asked about the other.  It might not
always guess right, in which case the appropriate `vdiff-magit-*'
command has to be used explicitly.  If it cannot read the user's
mind at all, then it asks the user for a command to run.
